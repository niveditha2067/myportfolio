<img src="project image 2.jpeg" alt="Project Image">
<p>A game using Java by which the computer selects a random number within a range given by the user and allows the user to guess the correct number by giving clues after each attempt.</p>
<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>This project aims to create a game that allows users to guess a random number within a given range. The game provides clues after each attempt to help the user guess the correct number.</p>
<h2>My Contribution</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Designed and implemented the game logic using Java</li>
    <li>Created a user-friendly interface for the game</li>
    <li>Tested and debugged the game to ensure smooth functionality</li>
</ul>
<h2>Final Result</h2>
<p>The game was successfully implemented and tested, providing a fun and interactive experience for users. The game has the potential to improve cognitive skills and provide entertainment for users of all ages.</p>
